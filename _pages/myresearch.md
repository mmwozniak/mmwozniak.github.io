<p style="font-size: 80%;">
In my scientific work I am primarily interested in social, psychological and neural mechanisms of self and identity. 
</p>

<h3>What is the self and how it develops</h3>
<p style="font-size: 80%;">
What is the self? 
</p>

<h3>Plasticity of self-representation</h3>
<p style="font-size: 80%;">
There are aspects of the self that are stable across our lives and others that change in shorter and longer time scales.
</p>

<h3>Neural mechanisms of self-representation</h3>
<p style="font-size: 80%;">
I am also interested in how we represent ourselves on a neural level. I conduct EEG and FMRI studies looking at
  neural correlates of processing of self-related information. 
</p>

<h3>Self and other in joint action</h3>
<p style="font-size: 80%;">
 The ability to distinguish between self and other is critical when we interact with other people. 
</p>

<h3>Cultural evolution of the self</h3>
<p style="font-size: 80%;">
Our self-representations are shaped by society and culture.
