title: "Cultural Evolution of Group Identity"

---

<p style="font-size: 80%;">In this project we investigated cultural evolution of social identity. We assigned partivipants to minimal groups by telling them that they belong to a "Green" or "Blue" village. Then we showed them how often certain positive, neutral and negative traits occurr in each group. For example, we could tell them that: "40% of people in your village are friendly and 55% in the other village are friendly". Then they had to send this information to another person by indicating each number on a line from 0 to 100%.</p>

It also allows you to explore them by yourself. <a href="https://mmwozniak-cultevoself---dashboard-dashboard-cultevoself1-efs9wn.streamlit.app/">INTERACTIVE DASHBOARD</a></p>
