title: "Robot autonomy in the context of teleoperation"

---

<p style="font-size: 80%;">Robots are becoming more and more autonomous with each day. It means that they stop being passive excutors of commands that we issue to them, and become active partners of interaction with us. Therefore, there is a shift from control over robots to interaction with them. While robots that are under our control can be understood as our physical avatars, this interpretation become s more complicated when robots gain some level of outonomy. In this research topic across several studies we addressed the issue of how we percive robots that display different forms of autonomy.</p>
