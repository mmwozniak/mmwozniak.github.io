title: "Neural correlates of self-associated movements"

---

<p style="font-size: 80%">We showed full body movements to participants and asked which brain areas code them as MY versus OTHER'S movements. </p>
<p style="font-size: 80%">Our participants saw movements like this one and were told to play them in their memory as if they were watching THEMSELVES or ANOTHER person. </p>

<p style="font-size: 80%">We recorded their brain activity with fMRI and used MVPA to find which brain areas showed different patterns of activity for self- and other-attributed movements </p>
<p style="font-size: 80%">We found that attributed identity could be decoded from areas showing mirror activity (IFG, MFG), motor areas (SMA), and TPJ - which is regarded as a hub responsible for self-other distinction</p>

<p style="font-size: 80%">We also found that when participants learned that they need to encode a self-attributed movement then their vmPFC showed increased activation. vmPFC is a central hub responsible for processing of abstract self-related information.</p>
<p style="font-size: 80%">Our findings show how different aspects of the self (body-related and abstract) involve activity in different brain areas</p>
