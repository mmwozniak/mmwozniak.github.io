<p style="font-size: 80%;">I am a cognitive neuroscientist. In my scientific work I am interested in social, 
psychological and neural mechanisms of self and identity (see <b>My research</b> for details).
In my research I am especially interested in applying diverse methodological approaches from:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 80%;">
  <li>neuroscience (EEG, fMRI)</li>
  <li>experimental psychology</li>
  <li>data science & machine learning</li>
  <li>robotics</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 80%;">Currently I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at Social Cognition in Human-Robot Interaction Lab at Italian Institute of Technology in Genova, Italy
  where I investigate how operating a robot can influence our self-representation.</p>
