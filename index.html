<p style="font-size: 80%;">I am a scientist investigating human and artificial cognition, especially within the social context (social cognition). 
  In my scientific work I am interested in a range of topics spanning neuroscience, psychology, robotics, artificial intelligence, 
  computational social science, and consciousness science 
  (see <b>My research</b> for details).
In my research I am especially interested in applying diverse methodological approaches from:</p>
<ul style="font-size: 80%;">
  <li>neuroscience (EEG, fMRI)</li>
  <li>experimental psychology</li>
  <li>data science & machine learning</li>
  <li>robotics</li>
</ul>

<p style="font-size: 80%;">Currently I am an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Applied Psychology at 
  Jagiellonian University in Cracow, Poland and a senior Postdoctoral Researcher at Social Cognition in Human-Robot 
  Interaction Lab at Italian Institute of Technology in Genoa, Italy.</p>
