I am a cognitive neuroscientist and a data scientist. In my scientific work I am interested in social, 
psychological and neural mechanisms of self and identity (see **My Research** for details).
In my research I am especially interested in applying diverse methodological approaches from various fields:
- neuroscience (especially EEG, fMRI)
- experimental psychology
- machine learning

Currently I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Cognitive Science at Central European University in Vienna.
