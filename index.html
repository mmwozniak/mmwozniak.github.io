<p style="font-size: 80%;">I am a cognitive neuroscientist. In my scientific work I am interested in a range of topics 
  spanning cognitive neuroscience, social cognition, robotics, computational social science, and consciousness science 
  (see <b>My research</b> for details).
In my research I am especially interested in applying diverse methodological approaches from:</p>

  <li>neuroscience (EEG, fMRI)</li>
  <li>experimental psychology</li>
  <li>data science & machine learning</li>
  <li>robotics</li>
</ul>
